# PWN LOAN

## 1. Summary

PWN LOAN is a PWN contextual extension of a standard [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) token. **Each LOAN is defined as an ERC1155 NFT**. The PWN LOAN contract allows for reading the contextual information of the loans (like status, expirations, etc.) but **all of its contract features can only be called through the** [**PWN**](pwn/) **contract.**

### LOAN token lifecycle

The PWN LOAN token is a tokenized representation of a loan that can aquire different states:

* **Dead/None** - Loan is not created or has been claimed and can be burned.
* **Running** - Loan is created by passing offer data and offer signature signed by a lender.
* **Paid back** - Loan has been fully paid back before the expiration date. The LOAN owner is able to claim lent credit + interest.
* **Expired** - Loan had not been fully paid back before expiration date. LOAN owner is able to claim collateral.

### Loan token struct

Each LOAN token is defined by the LOAN token struct.&#x20;

**`LOAN`** token struct has the following properties:

| Type                                                                | Name              | Comment                                                                                                            |

| `uint32`                                                            | `duration`        | Loan duration in seconds                                                                                           |

| `MultiToken.Asset` (see [Asset struct](multitoken.md#asset-struct)) | `collateral`      | Asset used as a loan collateral. Consisting of another `Asset` struct defined in the MultiToken library            |
| `MultiToken.Asset` (see [Asset struct](multitoken.md#asset-struct)) | `asset`           | Asset to be borrowed by lender to borrower. Consisting of another `Asset` struct defined in the MultiToken library |
| `uint256`                                                           | `loanRepayAmount` | Amount of LOAN asset to be repaid                                                                                  |

## Functions

This contract inherits from the ERC1155 token standard. This comes with all of the ERC1155 functionalities like transfers etc. Please read the [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) specification for more details.&#x20;

## Events

PWNLOAN contract defines four events and no custom errors.&#x20;

```
event LOANCreated(uint256 indexed loanId, address indexed lender, bytes32 indexed offerHash);
event OfferRevoked(bytes32 indexed offerHash);
event PaidBack(uint256 loanId);
event LOANClaimed(uint256 loanId);
```

### `LOANCreated`

LOANCreated event is emitted when a borrower accepts an offer.&#x20;

This event has three parameters:

* `uint256 indexed`**`loanId`** - The ID of the LOAN token

* `bytes32 indexed`**`offerHash`** - [EIP-712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md) computed [hash](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/hashing/#TypedDataEncoder-hash) of the offer struct

### `OfferRevoked`

OfferRevoked event is emitted when a lender decides to revoke an offer.&#x20;

This event has one parameter:

* `bytes32 indexed`**`offerHash`** - [EIP-712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md) computed [hash](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/hashing/#TypedDataEncoder-hash) of the offer struct

### `PaidBack`

PaidBack event is emitted when a borrower repays a loan.&#x20;

This event has one parameter:

* `uint256`**`loanId`** - The ID of the LOAN token

{% hint style="info" %}
Lenders can listen to this event to get notified when their loan has been paid back.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### `LOANClaimed`

LOANClaimed event is emitted when a lender claims the repaid amount or loan underlying collateral in case of a default.&#x20;

This event has one parameter:

* `uint256`**`loanId`** - The ID of the LOAN token
