# Offer types

## 1. Summary

A lender can choose between two types while making an offer. **Basic and flexible**.

## 2. Offer Types Detailed

### Basic

The Basic offer is where the lender sets all loan parameters up-front and the borrower has an option to accept or not. Nothing else.

**`Offer`** struct has these properties:

| Type                                                                    | Name                 | Comment                                                                                                                                |

{% hint style="info" %}
With the flexible offer struct, we change the `collateralId`, `loanAmount`, `loanYield` and `duration` parameters to a range of these parameters.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Flexible

With flexible offers, lenders can give borrowers additional flexibility by not providing concrete values but rather giving borrower ranges for several parameters. When accepting an offer, a borrower has to provide concrete values to proceed. This increases a lender's chance of accepting their offer as it could be accepted by more borrowers.

**`FlexibleOffer`** struct has these properties:

#### Flexible offer values

When a borrower decides to accept a flexible offer they have to provide a specific representation of the offer. They do this by providing `FlexibleOfferValues` struct as the second argument for the [`createLoanFlexible`](./#createloanflexible) function.

**`FlexibleOfferValues`** struct has these properties:

| Type        | Name                   | Comment                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `uint256`   | `collateralId`         | Collateral token id. Ignored if itâ€™s not a collection offer                                      |
| `uint256`   | `loanAmount`           | Loan asset amount (always ERC20) in range \<loanAmountMin; loanAmountMax>                        |
| `uint32`    | `duration`             | Offered loan duration in range \<durationMin; durationMax>                                       |
| `bytes32[]` | `merkleInclusionProof` | Proof that selected collateralId is indeed in the Merkle tree with root in signed flexible offer |

#### How is the loan repay amount calculated?

$$
loanRepayAmount = loanAmount + \frac{loanYieldMax*duration}{durationMax}
$$

* `loanAmount` - Loan asset amount (always ERC20) in range \<loanAmountMin; loanAmountMax>
* `loanYieldMax` - Amount of tokens which acts as a lender's loan interest for max duration
* `duration` - Offered loan duration in range \<durationMin; durationMax>
* `durationMax` - Maximum loan duration in seconds
